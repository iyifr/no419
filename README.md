## NO_419

This is a project I built for that moment in life where you ask
yourself .. "Is this a scam ?"... "Did I just get scammed ?"... "What
if this is just a scam ?"

419 is a common slang term used by Nigerians to refer to fraud. On
this website (No-419), see businesses and individuals who are accused
to be scammy.

People who have a similar experience to share can also contribute by
adding comments.

Goal of the website : If you "feel unsure" if the person who's calling
or emailing you is a scammer, check No-419.com to see if anyone has
spoken about him.

Other Goal of the website: If you get scammed, share your experience
so it doesn't happen to others

Ethics: This platform will not condone harassment. If harassment or
unfair allegations are tabled, they will be removed from the site. For
this purpose, maybe I will start another funny project...
"clearyourname.com"

So we can hear both sides of the story.
