## NO_419

This is a project I built for that moment in life where you ask 
"Is this a scam ?",
"Did I just get scammed ?",
"What if this is just a scam?"

419 is a common slang term used by Nigerians to refer to fraud. 
On this website (No-419), see businesses and individuals who are accused to be scammy.

People who have a similar experience to share can also contribute by adding comments.

Goal: If you "feel unsure" on whether the person who's calling or emaiing you is a scammer
Go to No-419 and check out whether anyone is talking about same person. 

Ethics: This platform will not condone harassment. If harassment or unfair allegations are tabled, they will be removed from the site. 
For this purpose, I will start another silly project... "clearyourname.com
